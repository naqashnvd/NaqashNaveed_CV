	\project
	{Five stage pipelined RISC-V processor with Integer and Float support (RV32IF)}{}
	{\github{naqashnvd/RISC-V} {}{} }
	{The aim of this project was to build a running prototype of RISC-V processor i.e. RV32IF on FPGA. My implementation of RV32IF can be programmed using C to perform any float operation and display the result on computer through JTAG. This project was done using Altera DE-1 FPGA board and the language used was Verilog.}
